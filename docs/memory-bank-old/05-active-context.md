# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - MongoDB Repository Implementation
**Date**: Jun 11, 2025
**Objective**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Implemented INoteRepository with MongoDB database integration

## Recent Changes

### ✅ Server-Sent Events Implementation Complete (June 2025)

**Implementation Status**: Fully Complete and Documented
**Documentation**: Comprehensive guide available in `docs/guides/server-sent-events.md`

**Key Achievements**:

- **Event System Architecture**: Central event emitter with TypeScript interfaces and Zod validation
- **BaseService Pattern**: Consistent event emission across all services with proper inheritance
- **SSE Endpoint**: Authenticated streaming with ReadableStream API and proper authorization filtering
- **Real-time Updates**: Live notifications for note CRUD operations with heartbeat and connection management
- **Educational Value**: Complete event-driven architecture demonstration for student learning

**Files Implemented**:

- `src/events/event-emitter.ts` - Central event system with ServiceEventType interface
- `src/events/base.service.ts` - Base service class with protected emitEvent method
- `src/schemas/event.schema.ts` - Event schemas with generic data field and resource typing
- `src/routes/events.router.ts` - SSE endpoint with ReadableStream and authorization integration
- `src/services/note.service.ts` - Enhanced with event emission after successful operations
- Comprehensive test suite with full coverage

**Architecture Implemented**:

```
User Action → Service Layer → Event Emission → SSE Router → Connected Clients
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Business Logic → BaseService → EventEmitter → Authorization → Real-time UI
```

**Key Technical Decisions**:

- **Generic Event Schema**: `data: z.unknown()` allows different entity types while maintaining type safety
- **ReadableStream API**: Modern streaming approach instead of Hono's deprecated stream() function
- **Resource-based Authorization**: Event filtering follows same rules as CRUD permissions
- **Connection Management**: Proper cleanup with heartbeat and disconnect handling

### ✅ MongoDB Repository Implementation Complete (June 11, 2025)

**Implementation Status**: Fully Complete and Production Ready
**Educational Goal**: Demonstrate NoSQL database integration patterns and document-based data modeling

**Key Achievements**:

- **Production MongoDB Repository**: Complete `MongoDbNoteRepository` implementing `INoteRepository` interface
- **Database Connection Management**: Singleton pattern with graceful shutdown and environment-based configuration
- **Document-Entity Mapping**: Clear separation between MongoDB documents and domain entities with Zod validation
- **Performance Optimization**: Automatic index creation for query performance (createdBy, createdAt, content text search)
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite using `mongodb-memory-server` for isolated testing environment

**Files Implemented**:

- `src/repositories/mongodb/note.mongodb.repository.ts` - Production MongoDB repository implementation
- `src/config/mongodb.setup.ts` - Database connection management with singleton pattern
- `src/env.ts` - MongoDB environment variables with Zod validation
- `src/server.ts` - Enhanced with database connection lifecycle management
- `tests/config/mongodb.global.ts` - Global test setup for MongoDB Memory Server
- `tests/config/mongodb.setup.ts` - Test database mocking and connection management
- `tests/repositories/note.mongodb.repository.test.ts` - Comprehensive integration tests

**Key Technical Decisions**:

- **Direct MongoDB Driver**: Uses `mongodb` package directly instead of Mongoose for educational transparency
- **Zod Schema Validation**: Maintains single source of truth for data validation across all layers
- **Lazy Collection Loading**: Collections initialized on first use for better separation of concerns
- **ObjectId Handling**: Proper conversion between MongoDB ObjectIds and string IDs in domain models
- **Index Management**: Idempotent index creation for performance optimization
- **Connection URI Construction**: Flexible authentication support with optional credentials

**Educational Patterns Demonstrated**:

```typescript
// Document to Entity mapping with validation
private mapDocumentToEntity(doc: WithId<MongoNoteDocument>): NoteType {
  const { _id, ...restOfDoc } = doc;
  return noteSchema.parse({
    ...restOfDoc,
    id: _id.toHexString(), // Convert ObjectId to string
    createdAt: doc.createdAt,
    updatedAt: doc.updatedAt,
  });
}

// Performance optimization with indexes
private async createIndexes(collection: Collection<MongoNoteDocument>): Promise<void> {
  await Promise.all([
    collection.createIndex({ createdBy: 1 }, { name: "notes_createdBy" }),
    collection.createIndex({ createdAt: -1 }, { name: "notes_createdAt_desc" }),
    collection.createIndex({ content: "text" }, { name: "notes_content_text" }),
  ]);
}
```

**Testing Infrastructure**:

- **MongoDB Memory Server**: Isolated test environment without external dependencies
- **Global Test Setup**: Proper lifecycle management for test database
- **Mocked Database Module**: Clean separation between test and production database connections
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: All CRUD operations, pagination, filtering, and error scenarios

## Next Steps

### Current Priority - Additional Learning Examples

1. **Additional Entity Examples** (Next Focus)

   **Objective**: Provide diverse learning examples demonstrating different patterns and relationships

   **Implementation Plan**:

   - **User Entity**: User management with profile data (teaches user modeling and authentication concepts)
   - **Product Entity**: E-commerce style entity with categories (teaches business domain modeling)
   - **Order Entity**: Complex entity with relationships (teaches entity relationships and foreign keys)
   - **Category Entity**: Simple lookup entity (teaches basic CRUD and enumeration patterns)

   Each would follow the established Note pattern across all 6 layers, providing students with multiple examples to study and learn from.

### Future Development Areas

1. **Additional Database Examples**: PostgreSQL implementation for SQL learning comparison
2. **Performance Features**: Redis caching integration for optimization concepts
3. **Advanced Patterns**: Event sourcing, CQRS for senior student learning
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment workflows
5. **Observability**: Logging, monitoring, and metrics integration for production readiness education
